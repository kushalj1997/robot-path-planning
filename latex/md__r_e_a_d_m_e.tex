\section*{Goals}

Generate map for a circular robot to traverse.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Find the optimal path from a given start location to given end location. Approaches
\item Use B\+FS or Dijkstra\textquotesingle{}s to calculate an optimal path.
\item Use A$\ast$ to generate the probabilistic model of graphs to traverse through with B\+B8
\end{DoxyItemize}

\section*{Deliverables}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Create an interface to build up a map for robot.
\item Place obstacles on the map.
\item Visualize the map and the optimal path that robot will traverse.
\item Save and load the map from a file.
\item Provide example usage of the library.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\section*{Interface}

\subsection*{Map Class}

This should contain a binary grid of the map with each spot containing distances to the closest obstacle.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Takes in initial parameters of map size (M x N) and robot radius.
\end{DoxyItemize}

Have a function to add obstacles to the map.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item This should take in as parameter a list of circular obstacles
\end{DoxyItemize}

Class should create the best safe path given a start and end location on the map.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Generate the configuration space within which to plan a path.
\item Use Dijkstra\textquotesingle{}s algorithm.
\item Use A$\ast$ algorithm.
\item Compare the performance of these two approaches.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{\mbox{\hyperlink{struct_obstacle}{Obstacle}} Class}

Holds an obstacle with given center and radius. Simplified to a struct, change to a class if more complexity is needed.
